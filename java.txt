JAVA Day 01

JAVA is a software based platform
To run JAVA appln we dont have to rely on infrastructure provided by 3rd party vendor

In java library(.jar) there are packages (sub-packages,enum,interface,class,Error,Exception,Annotation)

Framework 
Framework may contain library 1,library 2 ,library 3
eg= struts,hibernate,Spring
Hibernate : Automatic Persistence Framework
Framework is library of readymade / reusable classes for faster developement for developer, code reusability should be acheived.

Why do we need datastructure to arrange data to save space in RAM.

Program is a set of statements.Every Instruction given to the computer is statement. Every instruction is made up of tokens{identifier,keyword,operator,Constant ,Seperator}

Name given to variable ,class ,method is called as identifier.

keyword is a reserved word which we cannot use as a identifier.

JAVA language is both technology and platform .(technology helps us to build an application so we can create standalone appln , web appln)

Application Programming Interface:
In JAVA API is Interface ,class ,Enum	
JAVA SE is used to create standalone application which means it do not require client/server arhitecture.


JAVA SE platform has two main components
JAVA API 
JVM


JAVA Program ===> JAVA Compiler ===> JAVA Application ===> (JAVA API +JVM) ===> OS 	===> 	Hardware
(java src code)   javac(in bin dir)	(.class/.jar)	  S/W only Platform   H/W based Platform  

rt.jar contains core java API
for e.g => Servlet "servlet-api.jar"
JSP "jsp-api.jar"
EL "el-jar"

Language Tools: Editor(VI Editor), Preprocessor(C/C++preprocessor),Compiler(gcc),Assembler(aicro assembler(masm for windows)),Linker,Debugger,Profiler,Build Tools,Loader

SDK = Language Tools + Documentation + Libraries + Runtime Environment

JDK Installation Directory
bin = Contains JAVA language developement tools
include = contain header files 
lib = contain the files used by the developement tools
src = contains the source code of JAVA Api
docs = Contain documentaion of JAVA API
jre = Root directory for JAVA Runtime Environment
man = Contain Documentation of JAVA Developement tools

WORA(Write Once Run Everywhere)

A class of which we can create object is called as concrete class , we can instantiate concrete class
instantiation==>process of creating instance(object) from a class. 
A class which cannot be extended or cannot create child class is called as final class

javac file_name.java
java file_name
 
for every class java compiler will create .class file
also for enum and interface.
//Type
System  : final class declared in java.lang Package
out	:It is reference of instance(object) of Prinstream class.It is public static final field of System class.
print,printf,print: non static method of  java.io. PrintStrem class.

In JAVA you cannot define anything global i.e. main method should be inside class.
Calling a main method is a job of JVM not OS.
We can overload main method in java

JAVA Day 02
 
JAVA specification = Abstract classes + Interfaces
JAVA Language Specification is provided by oracle defined by java community process.
JVM Specs Oracle -> JCP 

java.lan g package contains all the fundamental packages of core JAVA
java.lang package is imported by default in every .java file.

System class has 3 fields 
in  type=> static InputStream (public static final InputStream in) //ref
out    	   static PrintStream
err        static PrintStream

out is the field in the system class of type printstream and println is the method of printstream class.

System.in,System.out,System.err Standard stream objects of Java.

PrintStream is a class declared in java.io package.
print,printf and println are non static , overloaded method of java.io.PrintStream class.

Data Type
Memory : how much memory is required to store the data.
Nature : Which type of data is allowed to store inside memory
Operation : Which opertions (functionality) are allowed to perform on data.
Range : Set of Values which are allowed to store inside memory.

Primitive Data types 
It is also called as value type.
there are 8 primitive types
boolean,byte,char,short,int ,float,double,long
It gets space on JAVA Stack


Non Primitive Types
It is also called as Refernce Types
There are 4 non-Primitive /reference types in JAVA
Interface
Class
Enum
Array
Instance of Non-primitive type gets space on HEAP

Components of JVM
Class Loader Sub System
	It is responsible for loading .class from HDD 	into JVM memory.
	Types of class loader:
	1. Bootstrap classloader 
	2. Extension classloader
	3. Application classloader.

Runtime Data Areas
  1. Method Area
  2. Heap
  3. Java Stack
  4. PC Register
  5. Native Method Stack

Execution Engine
  1. Interpreter
  2. Just in Time (JIT) Compiler

Python is dynamically type checked language
C/Cpp/JAVA is statically type language (because it cannot decide the type of the variable by looking toward the value)

In C/ Cpp declared variable value is garbage but in JAVA if we do not intialize the variable it will throw error (In JAVA local value of local variable will not be zero).

int num =10;
Intialization is a process of storing user defined value inside variable during its declaration.
we can intialize any variable only once

To Convert Primitive type to Non-Primitive Type
int num = 10;
String str = Integer.toString(num);
This process of converting value of variable of primitive type into non primitive type (Boxing)

String s1 ="10";
int num1 = Integer.parseInt(s1)
Unboxing
